# What is Arinoglish? 
This is a special language invented by myself and is currently used in my imaginary nation: Arino

It's derived from Chinese and uses the exact same grammar and pronunciation as Chinese. The only thing that differs is the writing system. 

Instead of using the ideographic Chinese characters, Arinoglish uses a slightly modified version of the phonetic Chinese Pinyin.
